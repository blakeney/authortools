Command-Line Text Analysis Tools

Project Goals:

1. For me to improve my C programming skills
2. To publish fast, freely-licensed, CLI text analysis tools that others might find useful

Included Components:

1. wf - Word Frequency tabulator

Known Issues:

1. This code has been built and tested only with Clang on FreeBSD.
2. The assert macro is misused throughout the code, which would result in breakage if compiled without it.
